JsonRpcBundle
=============

JsonRpcBundle is a bundle for Symfony 2.3 and up that allows to easily build a JSON-RPC server for web services using `JSON-RPC 2.0`_.

The bundle contains a controller that is able to expose methods of any service registered in the Symfony service container as a JSON-RPC web service. The return value of the service method is converted to JSON using `jms\_serializer`_.

Of course, it doesn't simply expose all your services' methods to the public, but only those explicitely mentioned in the configuration. And service methods cannot be called by it's original name but by an alias to be defined in the configuration.


Installation
------------

1. Add "itscaro/jsonrpc-bundle" as requirement to your composer.json

2. Add "new Wa72\\JsonRpcBundle\\Wa72JsonRpcBundle()" in your AppKernel::registerBundles() function

3. Import the bundle's route in your routing.yml:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/routing.yml
    wa72_json_rpc:
        resource: "@Wa72JsonRpcBundle/Resources/config/routing.yml"
        prefix:   /jsonrpc

Your JSON-RPC web service will then be available in your project calling the /jsonrpc/ URL.
A Discovery JSON is available at /jsonrpc/discover/.

Configuration
-------------

You must configure which functions of the services registered in the Service Container will be available as web services.

Configuration is done under the "wa72\_json\_rpc" key of your configuration (usually defined in your app/config/config.yml).
To enable a Symfony2 service method to be called as a JSON-RPC web service, add it to the "functions" array of the configuration.
The key of an entry of the "functions" array is the alias name for the method to be called over RPC and it needs two sub keys:
"service" specifies the name of the service and "method" the name of the method to call. Example:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/config.yml
    wa72_json_rpc:
        functions:
            myfunction1:
                service: "mybundle.servicename"
                method: "methodofservice"
            anotherfunction:
                service: "bundlename.foo"
                method: "bar"

In this example, "myfunction1" and "anotherfunction" are aliases for service methods that are used as JSON-RPC method names.
A method name "myfunction1" in the JSON-RPC call will then call the method "methodofservice" of service "mybundle.servicename".

If you use `jms\_serializer`_ you can also configure exclusion strategies (groups, version, or max depth checks) :

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/config.yml
    wa72_json_rpc:
        functions:
            myfunction1:
                service: "mybundle.servicename"
                method: "methodofservice"
                jms_serialization_context:
                    group: "my_group"
                    version: "1"
                    max_depth_checks: true

Starting with v0.4.0, it is also possible to fully expose all methods of a service by tagging it with ``wa72\_jsonrpc.exposable``.
All public methods of services tagged with 'wa72\_jsonrpc.exposable' can be called via JSON-RPC. The method name
to be used in the RPC call is "service\:method", i.e. the name of the service and the method separated by colon.

**New in Version 0.5.0**: It is now possible to call methods that require objects as parameters (in previous versions
only methods with scalar and array parameters could be called).
That's why *JMSSerializerBundle is now a required dependency*.
For this to work, the following conditions must be met:

- The method parameters must be correctly type hinted
- The classes used as parameters must contain `jms\_serializer @Type annotations for their properties <http://jmsyst.com/libs/serializer/master/reference/annotations#type>`_

Testing
-------

The bundle comes with a test service. If you have imported the bundle's routing to ``/jsonrpc`` (see above)
register the test service in your DI container:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # app/config/config_dev.yml
    services:
        wa72_jsonrpc.testservice:
            class: Wa72\JsonRpcBundle\Tests\Testservice
            tags:
              - {name: wa72_jsonrpc.exposable}

You should then be able to test your service by sending a JSON-RPC request using curl:

.. code-block:: bash

    curl -XPOST http://your-symfony-project/app_dev.php/jsonrpc/ -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"wa72_jsonrpc.testservice:hello","id":"foo","params":{"name":"Joe"}}'

and you should get the following answer:

.. code-block:: json

    {"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":"Hello Joe!","id":"foo"}

There are also unit tests for phpunit. Just install the required dependencies using ``composer install`` and run
``phpunit`` in the root directory of the project.
